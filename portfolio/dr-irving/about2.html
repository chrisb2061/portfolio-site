     	<h3><span>Dr. Irving's History of Kindness</span></h3>
        <p>By a unique series of circumstances Bobby Manheim was given a gift, although it may not have seemed so almost seventeen years ago. While recovering from back surgery and unable to walk for months, Bobby began working with a white-faced capuchin monkey who desperately needed to be rescued from a life unfit for any animal. This 1' 7", ten pound monkey had been confined in a very small cage. Despite being told by experts that this monkey would never socialize, Bobby accepted the challenge because of his background in working with animals.
        </p>
        <p>After ninety days of administering unconditional love and affection 24/7, Dr. Irving finally responded in a positive way by giving Bobby a hug and kiss. Overwhelmed with excitement about the change in behavior he ran to the telephone to report the good news to a friend. That was the first day that Bobby walked in almost a year! The same effect that Dr. Irving had on Bobby was the inspiration for this unique monkey to become the service animal he is today.
        </p>
        <p>Over the past sixteen years Bobby and Dr. Irving have been providing special needs children with this unique and beneficial therapy and spreading the message of unconditional love to more than fifty thousand school-aged and special needs children and adults each year.</p>
		<p>
Bobby and Dr. Irving give presentations that are motivating, educational and inspirational. Their programs include Character Education, Maintaining a Positive Attitude, Problem Solving, Responsibility, Health, Fitness, Anti-bullying Campaigns, Helping Special Needs Kids, and sharing specific information about Dr. Irving, and more.	</p>
